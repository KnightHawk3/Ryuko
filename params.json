It's pretty neat so like if you like gifs, use it.\r\n\r\n## How to use Ryuko!\r\nThis is aimed at begginers with no command line knowledge. If you know what your doing, here is the outline.\r\n\r\n1. Clone Ryuko\r\n2. Run with Python 2.7\r\n3. Add it to your path if you want.\r\n\r\nSkip to the next section if you want help on the command.\r\n### Setting things up\r\nClone (`git clone`) or download this repository (The \"Download Zip\" button on the left if you don't know what I mean). Extract everything if you downloaded an archive.\r\n\r\n`cd` into the directory where you extracted Ryuko to and use `python ryuko.py` to run it. Here is the example output.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS F:\\code\\Ryuko> python .\\ryuko.py\r\nusage: ryuko.py [-h] [-f] [-b] [-fps FPS]\r\n                input_file output_file start duration\r\nryuko.py: error: too few arguments\r\n```\r\nIf you see an error along the lines of \"Python not found\" or that Python isn't a command, go and make sure python (2.7 is used) is in your path and uses the command `python`. If you got output like mine, you are ready to rock and roll!\r\n\r\n### Using Ryuko\r\nTo get the usage for `ryuko.py` just run `python ryuko.py -h`\r\n```\r\nusage: ryuko.py [-h] [-f] [-b] [-fps FPS]\r\n                input_file output_file start duration\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  input_file           The input video file (anything ffmpeg supports)\r\n  output_file          The name of the output gif.\r\n  start                The time in seconds to start the gif\r\n  duration             Duration to create the gif\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n  -f, --flip           Flip the image upside down.\r\n  -b, --use-builtin    Use the system `convert`, `ffmpeg` and `gifsicle`\r\n                       commands.\r\n  -fps FPS, --fps FPS  FPS of the gif\r\n```\r\nMost of the options are pretty self explanatory really, `input_file` is any video file that ffmpeg can use and `output_file` is the name of your gif. `start` is the time in seconds to start creating the gif and `duration` is how long to make the gif. The other flags are `-f` to flip the image upside down, `-b` to use the builtin commands (Use this on not windows!) and `-fps FPS` is the FPS of the gif.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n#### Create a gif\r\n```\r\nPS F:\\code\\Ryuko> python .\\ryuko.py .\\knk03.mkv output.gif 600 3\r\nExtracting frames (call this 25%)\r\nCreating gif (Call this 80%)\r\nOptimising (Call this 99%)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the most basic usage of the command, in human terms it says \"Create a gif of knk03.mkv at 600 seconds that lasts 3 seconds and name it output.gif\"\r\n\r\n![The gif created. It has a nice flame in the background](http://i.minus.com/ibaeDDpeiW0GIu.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Create a gif with milliseconds\r\n```\r\nPS F:\\code\\Ryuko> python .\\ryuko.py .\\knk03.mkv output2.gif 543.1 1.8\r\nExtracting frames (call this 25%)\r\nCreating gif (Call this 80%)\r\nOptimising (Call this 99%)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we just added a decimal place and it works. Pretty neat.\r\n\r\n![Akhito nodding. Yet another example gif.](http://i.minus.com/idfntneToCDxi.gif)\r\n#### Create and flip a gif\r\n```\r\nPS F:\\code\\Ryuko> python ryuko.py -f knk05.mkv output3.gif 950.5 3\r\nExtracting frames (call this 25%)\r\nCreating gif (Call this 80%)\r\nOptimising (Call this 99%)\r\n```\r\n![Mirai Kuriyama modeling for a camera](http://i.minus.com/iY6oDoLztpi70.gif)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
